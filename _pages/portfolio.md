## My path to be a cross-major applier

### Why a Shift in Focus?
I initially chose Financial Engineering out of a keen interest in understanding the mechanics behind financial systems. However, after delving into the industry, I found that most of the work involved in financial markets constitutes a zero-sum game and does not bring about incremental solutions to real-world problems. The cycle of writing reports, analyzing research, and attending meetings became monotonous and less fulfilling for me. My foray into society operations similarly revealed that the impact of hard work does not necessarily translate into personal achievement but often depends on marketing and connections. These experiences have led me to consider the path of academia.

### Why a PhD?
My intent for pursuing a PhD is multifaceted. First, I am driven by an insatiable curiosity to expand the boundaries of human knowledge. Whether it's improving existing Deep Learning frameworks or optimizing current techniques like ADAM, I see vast room for improvement and innovation. ChatGPT and other advanced models illustrate the significance of standing on the shoulders of giants. Furthermore, while Deep Learning has indeed made life convenient through face recognition and object detection, there's potential to take these architectures further by incorporating other optimization models or structures like Graph Neural Networks.

In addition to technological advancements, I'm excited about the prospect of applying machine learning in other domains based on prior knowledge, which I find extremely intriguing. The ultimate goal for me is to get closer to the truth and make meaningful contributions to improve our daily lives.

Another aspect that excites me about a PhD journey is the opportunity to cultivate independent research skills. During my past research on rumor dynamics using Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC), I encountered problems but lacked the precise know-how to tackle them. The rigorous environment of a PhD program will equip me with the skills to conceptualize and implement solutions to complex issues.

### My Future Goals
Through the course of my PhD, I aim to build upon my existing skill set and explore the immense possibilities that the world of algorithms and AI has to offer. I am open to collaboration and would be thrilled to be a part of any research group that shares my interest in making breakthroughs in AI technology. Ultimately, my aim is to contribute my own bit to the vast world of knowledge and tackle real-world problems with impactful solutions.
